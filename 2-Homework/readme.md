## Cybersecurity Homework README

### Strategies for Completing Homework

- Budget time during the week for studying and completing homework. If possible, set aside three hours three to four times a week. The coursework won’t feel as overwhelming and you won’t be working on assignments last-minute.

- If you are having trouble, don't dwell on one part of a homework assignment for an extended period of time. If you do get stuck, continue on to the next activity and reach out to your TAs or classmates for assistance.

- Create **homework study groups**: You're encouraged to collaborate with your classmates to work through assignments and solve problems. A fresh perspective and another pair of eyes can help you overcome a bug or understand a challenging concept. Form study groups with your peers and learn from each other in the process.

- You will get more out of class if you keep pace with homework. The homework assignments are how you absorb the deep learning you need to succeed as Cybersecurity professionals.
